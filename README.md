# Assignment 5 – Loop Challenges

This project demonstrates mastery of **while loops, for loops, and nested loops** in Python.

## Challenge 1: Collatz Sequence
- Uses a **while loop** because we don’t know how many iterations are required.
- Keeps running until the number reaches 1.
- Outputs the sequence and counts total steps.

## Challenge 2: Prime Number Checker
- Uses a **for loop** because the divisor range is known (2 to n-1).
- Checks if any number divides evenly into `n`.
- Stops early if divisor found.

## Challenge 3: Multiplication Table
- Uses **nested loops**: outer loop for rows, inner loop for columns.
- Generates a clean multiplication grid from 1 to 10.

## Git Workflow
- Challenge 1 Commit: `"Challenge 1: Collatz sequence - while loop for unknown iterations"`
- Challenge 2 Commit: `"Challenge 2: Prime checker - for loop for known range"`
- Challenge 3 Commit: `"Challenge 3: Multiplication grid - nested loops for 2D data"`
- Documentation Commit: `"Add loop design documentation"`

## AI Usage
AI assistance was used for **debugging, code review, and formatting suggestions**.
